# AI Powered Combinatorial Polymer Design
The AI powered combinatorial polymer design is one of the handy tools that would allow us to find the feasibility of any polymer before clinical trials
<br><br>
This tool works by judging certain factors such as chemical bonding & structure, physical & chemical properties (desired vs actual), success rate, production cost, etc. (Each parameter can be manually adjusted)
<br>
The tool uses AI and Combimatrics to calculate the probability for the parameters of the polymer.
